        Given OAuth is enabled
        And I am not logged in
        When I log in
        And I ask for a new access token
        Then the response code should be 200
        And the JSON response will contain access_token
        And the JSON response will contain token_type 
        And the JSON response will contain expires_in

        Given OAuth is enabled
        And I am not logged in
        When I log in
        And I ask for a new access token without the grant_type field
        Then the response code should not be 200
